# After logging into lugh, run this series of commands to assemble the test dataset.

# Let's start by making a directory to store all the files related to this project: 
mkdir 01-assembly
cd 01-assembly

# fastq files for assembly are in: /mnt/scratch/AppliedGenomics/GenomeAssembly/
# To look at these files, one could use: less /mnt/scratch/AppliedGenomics/GenomeAssembly/SRR8420302_1.fastq
# Simply type 'q' to exit less

# Let's prepare a script file to submit to the job scheduler:
touch assemble-genome.sh
chmod +x assemble-genome.sh # Making the file executable.

# Edit the file with your favorite text editor (for example gedit):
gedit assemble-genome.sh

# Here is the text you would type into assemble-genome.sh:
#!/bin/bash

module load spades/3.13.0
cd ~/01-assembly
spades.py --only-assembler -1 /mnt/scratch/AppliedGenomics/GenomeAssembly/SRR8420302_1.fastq -2 /mnt/scratch/AppliedGenomics/GenomeAssembly/SRR8420302_2.fastq -o assembly

#------------------------

# Now we can submit the job to the scheduler:
qsub assemble-genome.sh
