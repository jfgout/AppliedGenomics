# Applied Genomics - Lab 01 - Connecting to the supercomputer


# 1. Prerequisites:

# 1.1: VPN (Virtual Private Network)

To connect to the supercomputer, you need to be looged into the Mississippi State network. Unless you are 
connected using an ethernet cable on the campus, you will need first to log into the msstate virtual private 
network (vpn).
This requires the installation of a piece of software on your computer. Instruction on how to do this are 
available here:

For MacOS: https://servicedesk.msstate.edu/TDClient/KB/ArticleDet?ID=1547
For Windows: https://servicedesk.msstate.edu/TDClient/KB/ArticleDet?ID=1546

Follow the instructions on the msstate service desk to (links provided above) to install Cisco AnyConnect VPN 
and log into the msstate VPN.


# 1.2: SSH Client

Connection to the supercomputer is done using SSH (Secure Shell). A shell is a user interface which can 
be used to send command to a computer. In this first lab, you will learn the basic usage of a shell.


# 1.2.a: MacOS Users.

MacOS already contains all the tools needed. Launch the "Terminal" app and type: ssh [login]@lugh.biology.msstate.edu
where [login] is to be substituted by your actual login name.

If you have difficulties locating the Terminal app, you can find some help here: https://macpaw.com/how-to/use-terminal-on-mac

# 1.2.b: Windows computers:

By default, Windows does not ship with an ssh/terminal app (although that might not be true of the very latest versions).
Windows users should install the following software: MobaXterm (available for free here: https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)

After installing and launching MobaXterm, you can connect to the server with the following command line: ssh [login]@lugh.biology.msstate.edu
where [login] is to be substituted by your actual login name.

IMPORTANT: when prompted for the password, it will look like nothing is happening when you type the password (there will be 
no starts/dots showing hidden password entry). This is normal. Simply type (or copy/paste) your password and press Enter.

You should see the following
